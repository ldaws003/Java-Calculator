# Java-Calculator
A calculator made using JFrame.
After using the multiply, divide, subtract, and add buttons you have to input another
number and press the equal sign. Currently the measurement of angles are in radian.
You will need to use Java 8 when using Eclipse. Earlier versions may work, but JFrame doesn't work with Java 10
and you will get an error whenever you go to the design window.
